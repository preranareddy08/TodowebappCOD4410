**INTERN INFORMATION**

Name:Prerana Reddy

Intern ID:COD4410

**IMPLEMENTATION**

Dynamic Web App for creating task-list for a day.Includes adding,deleting and checking task. -Local Storage is used to store tasks,and actions persist even after refresh. Technologies used: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript.

**DESCRIPTION**

HTML Code:

Structure: The HTML defines the basic structure of the todo list application with clear sections for the header, input field, todo list, and buttons. This structure makes it easy to understand and navigate the different parts of the application.

Semantic Elements: Semantic HTML elements are used appropriately to represent headings, input fields, buttons, and lists. This enhances accessibility and SEO optimization.

CSS Code:
Custom Styling: The CSS code provides custom styling to the various components of the todo list application. For example, it defines background colors, fonts, borders, and padding to create an aesthetically pleasing design.

Responsive Design: Bootstrap classes and custom CSS ensure that the application layout remains responsive across different screen sizes and devices, providing a consistent user experience.


Certainly! Let's highlight some important features from the provided code snippets:

HTML Code:
Structure: The HTML defines the basic structure of the todo list application with clear sections for the header, input field, todo list, and buttons. This structure makes it easy to understand and navigate the different parts of the application.

Semantic Elements: Semantic HTML elements like <h1>, <input>, <button>, and <ul> are used appropriately to represent headings, input fields, buttons, and lists. This enhances accessibility and SEO optimization.

CSS Code:
Custom Styling: The CSS code provides custom styling to the various components of the todo list application. For example, it defines background colors, fonts, borders, and padding to create an aesthetically pleasing design.

Responsive Design: Bootstrap classes and custom CSS ensure that the application layout remains responsive across different screen sizes and devices, providing a consistent user experience.

JavaScript Code:

Local Storage Handling: The code efficiently handles storing and retrieving todo items from the browser's local storage. This ensures that todo items persist even when the user refreshes or navigates away from the page.

Dynamic Todo Manipulation: Functions like onAddTodo(), onTodoStatusChange(), and onDeleteTodo() enable dynamic manipulation of todo items. Users can add new todos, mark them as completed, and delete them with ease.

Event Handling: Event listeners are attached to buttons (addTodoButton, saveTodoButton) and checkbox inputs to respond to user interactions. This makes the application interactive and user-friendly.

Rendering Todos: The createAndAppendTodo() function dynamically generates HTML elements to represent todo items and appends them to the DOM. This allows todos to be rendered on the screen based on the data stored in the todoList array.

Loop Iteration: A loop iterates over the todoList array to render existing todos on page load. This ensures that todos are displayed to the user when they revisit the application.

**CONCLUSION**

The code snippets demonstrate key features of a todo list application, including structured HTML markup, custom CSS styling, and dynamic JavaScript functionality. Together, these features create an intuitive and responsive user interface for managing todo items effectively.
